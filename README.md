# Aviation Accident Risk Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 to uncover patterns, trends, and insights to improve aviation safety. The insights aim to assist stakeholders in understanding risks and making informed decisions to enhance operational safety.

### *Objectives:*
-Identify safest aircraft types.

-Analyze causes and trends in aviation accidents.

-Provide recommendations for improving safety.

2.Data Understanding.
This dataset, sourced from the National Transportation Safety Board, includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters. The dataset provides information on aviation accidents, including key details about the incidents, aircraft, and conditions surrounding each event.

### Purpose:
This dataset enables us to analyze aviation accidents for patterns, identify high-risk aircraft or conditions, and provide insights to guide safe and strategic business decisions in aviation operations.

Tools: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Steps
**1. Data Understanding**
Explored dataset features, including dimensions and types of incidents (accident vs. incident).
Highlighted key features critical to aviation safety analysis.
**2. Data Cleaning**
Handled missing data by imputing, standardizing, or discarding values where necessary.
Standardized column names for consistency.
Ensured data quality through duplicate removal and datatype conversions.
**3. Exploratory Analysis**
*a) Trend Analysis*
Visualized the number of accidents per year to assess safety improvements over time.
*b) Weather Impact*
Evaluated the effect of weather conditions on accident occurrence using bar charts.
*c) Correlation Analysis*
Created a heatmap to study relationships among injury severities.

# Summary

This project analyzes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 to identify trends, risks, and actionable insights aimed at enhancing aviation safety. Using data from the National Transportation Safety Board, key aspects such as weather conditions, injury patterns, and aircraft characteristics were explored. The findings reveal how accident rates have changed over time, the significant role of weather in accident occurrence, and strong correlations among different injury types. These insights inform recommendations for improved pilot training, aircraft safety features, and updated regulatory policies to foster safer aviation operations.
